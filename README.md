# Uncommon HTML Bugs
This repository demonstrates two relatively uncommon but potentially problematic errors in HTML:

1. **Accessing a Non-Existent Attribute:** Attempting to retrieve the value of an attribute that does not exist on an element.
2. **Missing Closing Tag:**  Omitting the closing tag for an element, which can lead to unexpected rendering behavior and validation errors.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides corrected versions.

## How to reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser. Observe the console output and the layout issues due to the missing closing tag. 
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected code and the expected behavior.
